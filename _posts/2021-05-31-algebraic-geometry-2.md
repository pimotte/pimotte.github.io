## Exercise 2.1

We choose $$X = \mathbb{A}^2$$. Then we choose $$\varphi: (t_1, t_2) \to (t_1, t_1t_2)$$. By Lemma 2.13, this is a morphism. 

For $$t_1=0, \varphi(0, t_2) = (0, 0)$$. For $$t_1 \neq 0, \varphi$$ takes exactly the values $$\{(a,b) \in \mathbb{A}^2: a \neq 0 \}$$.


## Exercise 2.2

(i): Let $$[U_1, f_1], [U_2, f_2] \in \mathscr{O}_{Y,Z}$$. Then $$k_1[U_1, f_1] + k_2[U_2, f_2] = [U_{12}, k_1f_1 + k_2f_2]$$.
To show this is an element of $$\mathscr{O}_{Y,Z}$$ we need to show $$U_{12} \cap Z \neq \emptyset$$. Note that $$U_{12}$$ is a non-empty open set in $$Y$$, hence it is dense, so it's dense in $$\overline{Z}$$, and $$Z$$ is open in $$\overline{Z}$$, so it intersects $$U_{12}$$.

The unique maximal ideal is $$I = \{[U, f] \in \mathscr{O}_{Y, Z} : f(z) = 0 \forall z \in Z \cap U\}$$. This is clearly an ideal. Let $$[U, g] \in \mathscr{O}_{Y,Z} \setminus I$$, then it has an inverse $$[U \setminus g^{-1}(0), \frac{1}{g}]$$, so this is maximal. 

(ii): The inclusion map $$\mathscr{O}_{Y,Z} \to \mathscr{O}_{Y,\overline{Z}}$$ is injective: If $$[U, f] = 0$$ on $$\overline{Z}$$, then it also is on $$Z$$. Then, to prove the surjectivity, we need to show that $$U \cap \overline{Z} \neq \emptyset$$ then $$U \cap Z \neq \emptyset$$. This follows from the fact that $$U \cap \overline{Z}$$ is open and dense in $$\overline{Z}$$, so it has non-empty intersection with $$Z$$.

(iii): The homomorphism $$\mathscr{O}(Y) \to \mathscr{O}_{Y,Z}$$ is injective by Lemma 2.2(ii), hence we have an injection $$A(Y) \to \mathscr{O}_{Y,Z}$$. Localizing at $$\mathfrak{m}$$ yields an injective homomorphsim $$A(Y)_\mathfrak{m} \to \mathscr{O}_{Y,Z}$$. This is surjective by definition of $$ \mathscr{O}_{Y,Z}$$. TODO: This is slight bluff, I don't know why this would be the case.

## Exercise 2.3

This subgroup is of the form:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1&2\\
1&1\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
a&b\\
0&c\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1&2\\
1&1\\
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
-a+b+2c& 2a-b-2c\\
-a+b+c&2a-b-c\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Identifying with $$k[x_{11}, x_{12}, x_{21}, x_{22}]$$ we observe that $$x_{11} + x_{12} - x_{21} - x_{22} = 0$$ is a necessary condition. 

If we have this condition, we can write any matrix in the above form by choosing $$a= x_{21} + x_{22}, b = 3x_{21}+x_{22}-x_{11}, c = x_{11}-x_{21}$$, hence the ideal is generated by this polynomial. 

## Exercise 2.4

(i): $$f^{-1}(\mathfrak{m}_2)$$ is an ideal of $$R_1$$, and it's a proper ideal, since $$1 \notin \mathfrak{m}_2$$, so it must be contained in $$\mathfrak{m}_1$$, since that is the unique maximal ideal.

(ii): The embedding of $$\mathscr{O}_{Y,Z} \to \mathscr{O}_{Y,P}$$, which is clearly not a local ring homomorphism per exercise 2.2(iii).

(iii): We have $$\varphi^*: f \to f \circ \varphi$$. In this case $$\mathfrak{m}_2$$ are the regular functions that are $$0$$ at $$Q$$ and $$\mathfrak{m}_1$$ are the regular functions that are $$0$$ at $$P$$.

To prove: $$\mathfrak{m}_1 \subseteq (\varphi^*)^{-1}(\mathfrak{m}_2)$$.

Let $$g \in \mathfrak{m}_1$$
We show that $$g' = g \circ \varphi = \phi^*(g) \in \mathfrak{m}_2$$

$$
\begin{align*}
          (g \circ \varphi)(P) &= (g(\varphi(P))) \\
          &= (g(Q)) = 0 \\ 
\end{align*}
$$

so $$g'$$ is zero at $$P$$, so in $$\mathfrak{m}_2$$.

## Exercise 2.5

The elements of $$\mathrm{SL}_4$$ are of the form:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
x_{11}& x_{12}\\
x_{21}& x_{22}\\
\end{pmatrix}
\to

\frac{1}{ad-bc}
\begin{pmatrix}
a&b\\
c&d\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_{11}& x_{12}\\
x_{21}& x_{22}\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
a&b\\
c&d\\
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
$$


The image is therefore of the form:

$$
\frac{1}{ad-bc}
\begin{pmatrix}
ad & -ac & bd & -bc\\
-ab & a^2 & -b^2 & ab \\
cd & -c^2 & d^2 & -cd \\
-bc & ac & -bd & ad \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

This results in at least the following equations

$$
\begin{align*}
x_{11} &= x_{44} \\
x_{12} &= -x_{42} \\
x_{13} &= -x_{43} \\
x_{14} &= x_{41} \\
x_{21} &= -x_{24} \\
x_{31} &= -x_{34} \\
x_{11}x_{12} &= x_{22}x_{34} \\
x_{11}x_{21} &= x_{22}x_{43} \\
x_{14}x_{13} &= x_{23}x_{31} \\
x_{14}x_{24} &= x_{23}x_{42} \\
x_{41}x_{31} &= x_{32}x_{13} \\
x_{41}x_{42} &= x_{32}x_{24} \\
x_{44}x_{34} &= x_{33}x_{12} \\
x_{44}x_{43} &= x_{33}x_{21} \\
\end{align*}
$$

TODO: How to continue? Seperate in cases for the different roots of $$x_{22} = a^2$$ etc? Also, intuitively, I think we need another equation from a dimensionality perspective?


(ii):

TODO: Restructure the map to something were we use one variabale less and then recover that information from the trace?


## Exercise A.2.3

If $$R$$ is a domain, then all elements in $$S$$ are invertible, so if elements are equal in $$S^{-1}R$$ then there exists a $$t \in S$$ such that 
$$t(r_1s_2-r_2s_1) = 0$$, so $$r_1s_2=r_2s_2$$, which is the equivalence condition for $$\mathrm{Frac}(R)$$. Definition of $$\varphi$$ shows it's simply the inclusion.

## Exercise A.2.4

Suppose $$S$$ has no zero divisors. Let $$r \in \ker \varphi$$. Then there exists $$t \in S$$ such that $$t(r\cdot 1-0)=0$$. Then either $$r = 0$$ or $$t$$ is a zero-divider, so $$\varphi$$ must be injective.

Let $$t \in S$$ be a zero divider. Then there exists an $$r \neq 0 \in R$$ such that $$rt = 0$$. Then $$t(r-0)=0$$, so $$r/1$$ is equal to $$0/1$$, so $$r \in \ker \varphi$$, so $$\varphi$$ is not injective.
