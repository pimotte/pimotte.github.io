## Exercise 2.1

We choose $$X = \mathbb{A}^2$$. Then we choose $$\varphi: (t_1, t_2) \to (t_1, t_1t_2)$$. By Lemma 2.13, this is a morphism. 

For $$t_1=0, \varphi(0, t_2) = (0, 0)$$. For $$t_1 \neq 0, \varphi$$ takes exactly the values $$\{(a,b) \in \mathbb{A}^2: a \neq 0 \}$$.


## Exercise 2.2

(i): Let $$[U_1, f_1], [U_2, f_2] \in \mathscr{O}_{Y,Z}$$. Then $$k_1[U_1, f_1] + k_2[U_2, f_2] = [U_{12}, k_1f_1 + k_2f_2]$$.
To show this is an element of $$\mathscr{O}_{Y,Z}$$ we need to show $$U_{12} \cap Z \neq \emptyset$$. Note that $$U_{12}$$ is a non-empty open set in $$Y$$, hence it is dense, so it's dense in $$\overline{Z}$$, and $$Z$$ is open in $$\overline{Z}$$, so it intersects $$U_{12}$$.

The unique maximal ideal is $$I = \{[U, f] \in \mathscr{O}_{Y, Z} : f(z) = 0 \forall z \in Z \cap U\}$$. This is clearly an ideal. Let $$[U, g] \in \mathscr{O}_{Y,Z} \setminus I$$, then it has an inverse $$[U \setminus g^{-1}(0), \frac{1}{g}]$$, so this is maximal. 

(ii): The inclusion map $$\mathscr{O}_{Y,Z} \to \mathscr{O}_{Y,\overline{Z}}$$ is injective: If $$[U, f] = 0$$ on $$\overline{Z}$$, then it also is on $$Z$$. Then, to prove the surjectivity, we need to show that $$U \cap \overline{Z} \neq \emptyset$$ then $$U \cap Z \neq \emptyset$$. This follows from the fact that $$U \cap \overline{Z}$$ is open and dense in $$\overline{Z}$$, so it has non-empty intersection with $$Z$$.

(iii): The homomorphism $$\mathscr{O}(Y) \to \mathscr{O}_{Y,Z}$$ is injective by Lemma 2.2(ii), hence we have an injection $$A(Y) \to \mathscr{O}_{Y,Z}$$. Localizing at $$\mathfrak{m}$$ yields an injective homomorphsim $$A(Y)_\mathfrak{m} \to \mathscr{O}_{Y,Z}$$. This is surjective by definition of $$ \mathscr{O}_{Y,Z}$$. TODO: This is slight bluff, I don't know why this would be the case.

## Exercise 2.3

This subgroup is of the form:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1&2\\
1&1\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
a&b\\
0&c\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1&2\\
1&1\\
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
-a+b+2c& 2a-b-2c\\
-a+b+c&2a-b-c\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Identifying with $$k[x_{11}, x_{12}, x_{21}, x_{22}]$$ we observe that $$x_{11} + x_{12} - x_{21} - x_{22} = 0$$ is a necessary condition. 

If we have this condition, we can write any matrix in the above form by choosing $$a= x_{21} + x_{22}, b = 3x_{21}+x_{22}-x_{11}, c = x_{11}-x_{21}$$, hence the ideal is generated by this polynomial. 

## Exercise 2.4

(i): $$f^{-1}(\mathfrak{m}_2)$$ is an ideal of $$R_1$$, and it's a proper ideal, since $$1 \notin \mathfrak{m}_2$$, so it must be contained in $$\mathfrak{m}_1$$, since that is the unique maximal ideal.

(ii): The embedding of $$\mathscr{O}_{Y,Z} \to \mathscr{O}_{Y,P}$$, which is clearly not a local ring homomorphism per exercise 2.2(iii).

(iii): We have $$\varphi^*: f \to f \circ \varphi$$. In this case $$\mathfrak{m}_2$$ are the regular functions that are $$0$$ at $$Q$$ and $$\mathfrak{m}_1$$ are the regular functions that are $$0$$ at $$P$$.

To prove: $$\mathfrak{m}_1 \subseteq (\varphi^*)^{-1}(\mathfrak{m}_2)$$.

Let $$g \in \mathfrak{m}_1$$
We show that $$g' = g \circ \varphi = \phi^*(g) \in \mathfrak{m}_2$$

$$
\begin{align*}
          (g \circ \varphi)(P) &= (g(\varphi(P))) \\
          &= (g(Q)) = 0 \\ 
\end{align*}
$$

so $$g'$$ is zero at $$P$$, so in $$\mathfrak{m}_2$$.

## Exercise 2.5

The elements of $$\mathrm{SL}_4$$ are of the form:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
x_{11}& x_{12}\\
x_{21}& x_{22}\\
\end{pmatrix}
\to

\frac{1}{ad-bc}
\begin{pmatrix}
a&b\\
c&d\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_{11}& x_{12}\\
x_{21}& x_{22}\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
a&b\\
c&d\\
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
$$


The image is therefore of the form:

$$
\frac{1}{ad-bc}
\begin{pmatrix}
ad & -ac & bd & -bc\\
-ab & a^2 & -b^2 & ab \\
cd & -c^2 & d^2 & -cd \\
-bc & ac & -bd & ad \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Simple case:

Determine the ideal of $$X = \{(a^2,ab,b^2) | a,b \in K\}$$.
The ideal of $$X$$ contains $$xz-y^2$$. We show that this polynomial generates I(X).
Let $$f$$ in $$K[x,y,z]$$ be a polynomial. Then $$f$$ in I(X) iff $$f(u^2,uv,v^2)=0$$ where $$u,v$$ are variables. 
Write $$f = \sum_{i,j,k} c_{ijk} x^i y^j z^k$$. Then the coefficient of $$f(u^2,uv,v^2)$$ at 
$$u^\alpha v^\beta$$ equals $$\sum_{i,j,k : 2i+j=\alpha, j+2k=\beta} c_{ijk}$$. 
It follows that I(X) is spanned linearly by the binomials $$x^i y^j z^k - x^{i'} y^{j'} z^{k'}$$ where $$2i+j = 2i'+j'$$ and $$j+2k = j'+2k'$$.
We now need to show that any such binomial is a multiple of $$xz-y^2$$. If $$\min(i,i')>0$$, we can divide by $$x$$.  
If $$\min(j,j')>0$$, we can divide by $$y$$. If $$\min(k,k')>0$$, we can divide by $$z$$.
So we may assume these minima are all zero. 
So the binomial equals one of $$\pm 1$$ times $$x^i y^j z^k - 1$$, $$x^i y^j - z^{k'}$$, $$x^i z^k - y^j$$ or $$y^jz^k - x^i$$
In the first case, $$i=j=k=0$$ and $$1-1$$ is indeed a multiple of $$xz-y^2$$. 
In the second case, the same.  In the third case, $$2i = j = 2k$$, and $$(xz)^k - y^{2k}$$ is indeed a multiple of $$xz-y^2$$. 
In the fourth case, $$i=j=k=0$$ again.

We note that we can write the above set as an intersection of sets in $$\mathbb{A}^{16}$$ of the following form, with all variables in $$k$$

$$
\begin{align*}

\end{align*}

## Exercise A.2.3

If $$R$$ is a domain, then all elements in $$S$$ are invertible, so if elements are equal in $$S^{-1}R$$ then there exists a $$t \in S$$ such that 
$$t(r_1s_2-r_2s_1) = 0$$, so $$r_1s_2=r_2s_2$$, which is the equivalence condition for $$\mathrm{Frac}(R)$$. Definition of $$\varphi$$ shows it's simply the inclusion.

## Exercise A.2.4

Suppose $$S$$ has no zero divisors. Let $$r \in \ker \varphi$$. Then there exists $$t \in S$$ such that $$t(r\cdot 1-0)=0$$. Then either $$r = 0$$ or $$t$$ is a zero-divider, so $$\varphi$$ must be injective.

Let $$t \in S$$ be a zero divider. Then there exists an $$r \neq 0 \in R$$ such that $$rt = 0$$. Then $$t(r-0)=0$$, so $$r/1$$ is equal to $$0/1$$, so $$r \in \ker \varphi$$, so $$\varphi$$ is not injective.

## Exercise A.2.7

(i): Let $$r_1 / f^n, r_2 / f^m \in R_f, k_1, k_2 \in k$$.

Then:

$$
\begin{align*}
    k_1(r_1 / f^n) + k_2 (r_2 / f^m) &= (k_1r_1f^m+k_2r_2f^n)/f^{n+m} &\in R_f \\
    (r_1 / f^n)(r_2 / f^m) &= (r_1r_2)/f^{n+m} &\in R_f \\
\end{align*}
$$

So $$R_f$$ is a $$k$$-algebra.


Suppose $$(r_1 / f^n)(r_2 / f^m) = 0$$, with both elements non-zero. Then $$(r_1r_2)/f^{n+m}=0$$, so there exists a $$n'$$ such that $$f^n(r_1r_2-0) = 0$$, so either $$f^n=0$$ or $$r_1r_2=0$$, but both yield a zero-divisor in $$R$$. So $$R_f$$ has no zero-divisors.

$$R_f$$ is generated by the generators of $$R$$ with $$1/f$$ added. An element $$r/f^n$$ can be expressed as polynomial of this set by writing $$r$$ as a polynomial of $$R$$s generators, then adding $$(1/f)^n$$ to each term, so $$R_f$$ is also finitely generated.

(ii): Suppose $$R_{\mathfrak{p}}$$ is finitely generated. Let $$p$$ be the irreducible polynomial determining
$$\mathfrak{p}$$. From the definition of addition and multiplication it is clear that no new prime factors can be introduced in the denominator by these operations. Let $$S'$$ be the set of prime factors of denominators present in the generators of $$R_{\mathfrak{p}}$$. Then $$1/(1+p\prod \{s: s \in S'\}$$ is an element of $$R_{\mathfrak{p}}$$, with at least one factor in the denominator that is not in any of the generators. Hence, it can not be expressed in terms of the generators, hence $$R_{\mathfrak{p}}$$ is not finitely generated.

## Exercise A.2.12

Note that $$x = r/s$$, and if it is in the intersection of $$R_{\mathfrak{m}}$$, then $$x \notin \mathfrak{m}$$ for any maximal ideal. 

Also note that $$s \in I$$. So, $$I$$ must be the whole ring, so $$1x \in R$$, so $$x \in R$$.
