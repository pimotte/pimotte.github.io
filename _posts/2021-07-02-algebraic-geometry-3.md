## Exercise 3.1

We consider $$q: \mathbb{A}^{n+1} \to \mathbb{P}^n$$.

Firstly, note that $$q$$ is continuous: Let $$U \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n$$ open. Then we can find a set of homogeneous polynomials $$S$$,
such that $$U = \bigcup_{F \in S}D_+(F)$$. But this means that $$q^{-1}(U)$$ can be written as the same union of $$D(f)$$, so $$q^{-1}(U)$$ is open.

Then, we show that the Zarinksi topology is the finest for $$q$$ to be continuous. Let $$\tau$$ be a topology on $$\mathbb{P}^n$$ such that $$q$$ is continuous. We show that if $$U \in \tau$$, then $$U$$ is open in the Zarinski topology. $$q^{-1}(U)$$ is open, so for some set $$S'$$ it can be written as $$q^{-1}(U) = \cup_{f \in S'}D(f)$$.

Claim: The ideal generated by $$S'$$ is homogeneous. 

Proof: We call this ideal $$I'$$. Let $$f' \in I'$$. Write $$f'= \sum f_j$$ as the sum of it's homogeneous parts. 
Let $$p \in \mathcal{Z}(I')$$. Due to the construction of $$q^{-1}(U)$$, any scalar multiple of $$p$$ is also a zero.
Hence, if we consider the polynomial $$g(x, t) = \sum t^jf_j$$, then the polynomial $$g(p, t)$$ is identically zero, $$f_j(p)=0$$ for 
each zero in $$p$$, so, $$f_j \in I'$$, so $$I'$$ is homogeneous.

Therefore, $$\mathbb{P}^n \setminus U$$ corresponds to a homogeneous ideal, so it's closed, so $$U$$ is open.

Finally, showing that $$q$$ is a morphism.
